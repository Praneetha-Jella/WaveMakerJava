In a small village, there lived a wise old man.
 The villagers often came to the old man seeking advice. 
The old man was known for his wisdom, and every time the villagers had a problem, they would ask the old man what to do.
 The old man would listen carefully and then share his thoughts. 
His advice was always simple, yet it was the advice that helped the villagers the most.
